                <description>The character has one very special animal for every four</description>
                <description>levels the character has. The animal will be any natural</description>
                <description>animal and will be above average in any abilities the</description>
                <description>animal has: intelligence, charisma, and survival points.</description>
                <description>For example, a warrior might have a warhorse of</description>

                <description>The animal has one animal level beyond their normal</description>

                <description>changing to the animal form.</description>
                <description>   </description>
                <description>The character gains all the new form's abilities,</description>

                <description>Resistance' gain a bonus of two to saving rolls against</description>
                <description>most spells. This does not affect physical after-effects</description>
                <description>of a spell, nor things summoned or created by the spell.</description>
                <description>Thus, the character gains no bonus against a summoned</description>
                <description>creature, nor against the effects of most Conjuration</description>

                <description>with Wisdom as a major contributor and a Base of -1. On</description>
                <description>a successful backstab, the thief can make an assassinate</description>
                <description>roll. On a successful assassinate roll, the victim</description>
                <description>potentially has to face death, regardless of their</description>
                <description>current survival point total. If the victim's level is</description>
                <description>less than the victim's current survival points, compare</description>
                <description>the victim's injury point total to their level, rather</description>
                <description>than their survival, to determine whether the victim</description>
